{"review":"Amazon wants you to get used to asking alexa for everything, but while she can answer questions she can't DO simple things like simply search for bluetooth devices, tell you what she finds and you tell her the one to pair to. Nope. Anything remotely technical requires you to use this app. And this app is painful to use. It starts off tyrying to push echo dot conversations on me. It's got 3 buttons that all seem to do the same thing (start conversations with people over echos). If you tell alexa to conncet to bluetooth she tells you to use this app (why? Its the 21st century! Why cant you just find and pair without me having to manually do it in an app), but she then says to install the skill in smart home. Smart home, list devices.. Cant find bluetooth speakers. Ok, skills, i guess i have to install a stupid skill for bluetooth. The skills section of the app is a hot mess. The search funtion flatout DOES NOT WORK. On top of that, apparently we're still in the dark ages of smart devices because every vendor under the sun has their own stupid skills app they want you to install on alexa. This s reams of no standadizations yet. Alexa shouldnt need to learn \"skills\" to connect to smart devices. She has to simply because smart device manufacturers havent standardized things yet. Everyone of them wants to be primma donna with their own skill app, so in addition to painfully digging for it, you have to pray the vendor actually put time into making it work (theres a reason they have star ratings on the skills...ugh). Anyways, i have to google up how to pair alexa to bluetooth speakers (that very necessity means alexa is failing at her GD job, bc she tells me to go to this stupid app instead of doing it directly, and this app is a hot mess to use). There is a bluetooth section. But the app can only seem to find ONE device at a time. Your device didnt show up? Hit back and try again, like you're at a roullette table hoping your number comes up. Ugh! Finally my speakers show up, and the app sits there trying to connect. My phone takes like 2 seconds to connect to them when I do it through settings. But alexa (echo dot) takes forever. Why?! Then you exit, try again, but she lists them as a decice she knows BUT IS NOT PAIRED TO. PAIR TO THE GD SPEAKERS FFS! You click on them in the list, app cooks then finally pairs. Does alexa say anything to automatcally confirm she's using the speakers? No. So you have to ask her something stupid to get her to speak and see if shes using the speakers. This way more painful then it should be. You can make a list using her, but to delete it \"use the app\". Why? DELETE THE GD LIST WHEN I TELL YOU! And lists are useless. I make a list of songs. Tell alexa to play the songs in the list. Nope. She can't do that. I make a list of numbers. Give me the sum total of those numbers. Nope. They need to add WAY more functionality to lists if they're going to be of any use. They're basically one dimensional string arrays you cant do anything with. So close yet so far. Next we have the tplink smart plug amazon suggested we buy when we got the echo dot. Well we have a living room lamp thats a pita to turn on and off so it'd be great to just tell alexa to do that. Try to get that thing going is a pita in and of itself (plug in, install ANOTHER app, hook to it, hook to network, create yet another login, etc). Finally get it going as a smart plug. Now we have to pair it with alexa. Open skills, install more crap, look for device IN THE APP bc alexa is too stupid to pair using just voice, finally get them paired. \"Alexa turn on the (light name)\". \"I'm sorry I can't find that device.\" YES YOU CAN! I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT IN YOUR APP! I CAN EVEN USE YOUR APP TO MANUALLY TURN IT ON AND OFF! WHY CAN'T YOU VOICE COMMAND IT?! This was one of the reasons we got the echo dor and it CAN'T DO IT'S GD JOB! They need to make alexa be able to do more of this maintenance crap through her instead of this stupid app. They need to standardize smart devices and get rid of skills. But if they force you to install skills, FIX THE GD SEARCH. This app is painful and makes me want to get rid of alexa.","author":"PreliminaryHerring","review_source":"iTunes","rating":2,"title":"Painful","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-12-10T18:41:21.000Z"}

{"review":"New update is takes away ability to control play on echos, dots, and taps from app. When Amazon first came out with Echo I loved it and have a device in every room. Now I think it's suffering from it's popularity and Amazon can't handle the increased use of its service and is trying to reduce the load on its service reducing the functionality of the app and slowing the  responses from the devices. Now finding devices responding to random noise as wake word and sometimes not responding to wake word unless your a foot away and yelling, might as well use physical controls. Response to commands is deteriorating, Will give Alexa command to play song, Alexa responds with the correct title to the song but says it's not in the library even though I'm looking at the song with the exact title in my library. If I keep repeating the command with Alexa giving the EXACT SAME CORRECT SONG TITLE back every time eventually instead of saying she can't find the song it will start playing.  This may not sound like a review of the app but the app only has a use if the Alexa AI functions usefully.

I used to have TP-Link smart plugs but I've since replaces the ones that controlled lights to HUE. Ive disabled and deleted these plugs, but they constantly come back. They will have the same name as the HUE lights so it gets confused. It will work fine then randomly it will say the HUE device isn't responding, but it works fine if I go into the Phillips app or any of the other third party HUE apps to turn them on or off. \n\nThe latest patch added the ability to delete devices, but they still come back and it throws Alexa for a loop when three devices, two of which don't exist, are named living room. \n\nPlease, Amazon, you are an excellent company and Alexa is clearly the future, don't let google pass you by because your app that controls her is garbage.","author":"c-b-w","review_source":"iTunes","rating":2,"title":"Ugh!

Not sure what kind of network is needed, maybe one with no passwords? The app interface is just bad UX, plain and simple. Hit a back button and end up on the Home screen. Try to join a pw protected network and wait for the connection to fail so you can finally see the password prompt. Complete setup and you are stuck on a video tutorial screen.

The one that I got was minimally conversant in English and had what sounded like an Indian accent- as did all the other people in the room. Her help consisted of reading a manual to me - covering things that had no relevance to my problem.   Not surprisingly, I received no help. \n\nI did, however, receive an email from Amazon with a request to complete a survey. I complied, explaining my problem and basically asking that they call me. Of course, they did not call. \n\nNow don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am an Amazon Prime member and am happy with their Prime program, including Prime Pantry.

{"review":"We initially generally liked the app, although we found it somewhat confusing and unintuitive. Then I was spontaneous logged out of the App while travelling. I was trying to resolve my problem that I could not log on for days. \nI tried repeatedly to login. Aside from the annoying process of having to enter cryptogram images, I tried over and over again to login. Each time the app would look like it was accepting my login, only to return me to a fresh login screen. \nI contacted the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù desk via chat.  I was passed from representative to representative on chat, with representatives changing, even in the early stages of our conversation and without notice or explanation for the change. I was told to do things that I had told them I had already done. In the end I was told they would send my case to engineering. I received a simple email of things to try while I waited for a response. That email was a restatement of all the things that were all the basic things that the chat ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù had stubbornly suggested, even though I had already told them I had done those things. \nAfter again trying to restart my phone, the resumed chat help seemed to have no knowledge of my previous questions. \nFinally, when I heard from engineering I wrote back to say that I had finally gotten the app to connect, for no apparent reason, and after days of trying. \nI asked on question : Does the app not work when traveling outside the USA?\nInstead of getting a reply, I‚Äôve now received another email offering to help ‚Äúsolve my problem‚Äù, again with no apparent awareness of my specific situation, and asking me to call. \nI have given hours of my time to this annoying app and unhelpful process. \nI will not call. \nI will use the app that now seems to be working. \nIf I have further problems, I will return the device and will not waste my time re-engaging with the unhelpful Alexa help desk. \nIt‚Äôs too bad the service is so bad since my family was initially enjoying the Echo/Alexa products.","author":"ArtCanadian","review_source":"iTunes","rating":1,"title":"Impossible to login/Unhelpful Help","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-01-11T11:37:39.000Z"}

Yet, everything we have been able to apply has not only been useful, but fun. Consider this: when I was a kid, my parents sometimes still read by candle light. True story.

Skills setup was slightly challenging in the absence of printed instructions in the box with the Dot.  I had all of my smart plug connected devices enabled and controlled by Alexa in about 10 minutes. I did have to change abbreviated names to full names for Alexa to recognize and complete commands. I am impressed with the limited use I have employed so far. My next test will be disconnecting power and reconnecting to determine if there is continuity with the setup and connection to Amazon echo services since I do not intend to have my DOT connected 24/7 for privacy considerations.","author":"","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":4,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z"}

{"review":"Here are some helpful tips or troubleshooting that you can do if ever you are encountering some problems in your Echo devices:  *Connecting to your Wifi/Internet -make sure youre not connecting to a adhoc networks, and echo devices requires fast and stable connection so dont expect it to function properly if your connection isnt stable,  -Go to your alexa app\u0026gt;menu (three horizontal lines at the upper left hand of the screen) \u0026gt; settings\u0026gt;choose your echo device\u0026gt;update wifi and follow the steps in setting up your echo device -if you get an error message, make sure that you entered your wifi password correctly, restart your echo device, power cycle your router, reset if still not working or use a different device (even though some of your devices work properly with your wifi connection, the echo device is different, sometimes it depends on the compatibility of your router thats why you should check your ISP as well.)  *Echo device is not responding  -always check if the mic button on the echo device if it is RED because it means that its on MUTE and check on the alexa app if its offline or online.  -sometimes the echo device needs some refreshing, you can restart it by unplugging it from your power source and after full 20 seconds plug it back on again. -or you can move your device closer to your router -or you can power cycle your router -you can reset it as well but resetting the echo device is resetting everything and youre going to set it up again.    Learning is important and doing this basic troubleshootings can save time. Trust me this is based in experience and I know that this is frustrating and disappointing but still technology is not dormant so we should never stop learning as well. It may solve your issues and instead of calling support for this you can save your time :)   -Emblem.","author":"Darlene Petilla","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":5,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-06-12T00:00:00.000Z"}

However, Amazon in the past few iterations has added \"Alexa Calling\" to the app and the echoes and they rope you into activating it. Not only is it a manipulative and sleazy way to get people to \"opt-in\" (by making it very difficult to avoid opting in and still using the product), it also doesn't let you turn the feature off, you HAVE TO CALL AMAZON CUSTOMER SUPPORT to disable a very invasive unwanted and nearly useless feature.

{"review":"These features and I would've given a 5 star. Being able to link my tunein account. The ability to remove favorited podcast/station in tunein, (You can add but not remove). Also the ability to use voice commands with tunein to play podcasts in chronological order from first episode to last. The use of voice commands to play certain episodes of podcasts. The ability to fast forward/rewind in epiodes of podcasts. Until these features are added there is no point to include tunein as an in app feature. It actually makes using the in app version very frustrating and as useful as any generic bluetooth speaker.

There could be a little description in each mini pic because selecting each one and then getting sent back to homepage when looking for a new skill gets old fast. The skills are mostly garbage too. Either not written well or really obscure things few people want/need. So far Alexas only useful if you already have a bunch of other things you pay monthly for and alexa binds them together.

The rest of the features are similarly half-baked and poorly tested. The app is ok for checking up on your Echo but not much else.  Finally, on the latest update Amazon suddenly needs access to every permission on the phone.  Contact list, running apps, phone calls, everything.

{"review":"Drop In on Dots is 1 out of 5 stars. I've got excellent bandwidth and an awesome wireless router. After getting the fancy email, I felt very excited about Drop In. Like when the update related for Zune revealing fancy new wireless functionality, it was like a bonus - remember?! Drop in however in my book, should never have been released in its current state. It's not solid, fades in and out, the volume is too low and uses the onboard speaker, breaking the bluetooth connection to that speaker, and is an embarrassment. I had someone excited to experience the new feature, but drop in was dropping out. I hope someone at amazon sees this post and explains why this was released when I'd give it a 2 out of 10 for overall satisfaction.

{"review":"This app is so slow and buggy. What prompted me to write the review was that there's no easy way to explore amazon music unlimited's options for artists. There are so many artists that a basic scroll  (which takes forever to load) makes it so hard to navigate. Additionally, the artists with \"the\" in the title are all listed under \"the\" alphabetically. There's no filtering in order to narrow it down to the artists you want. I think the purpose of this app is to help navigate all of the things Alexa can do for you, and it's so immensely frustrating.

{"review":"Disappointing. Both Echo and the Alexa app. The weather skill can't even tell you humidity. Now, as of July 28, control of Wemo devices has become erratic and semi-functional. I have updated Wemo device firmware, re-enabled the Wemo account connection, re-dscovered devices within the Alexa app, but it's still extremely retarded, with very long delays between the command and whatever execution it decides to implement (which varies from attempt to attempt.) I might blame Wemo, since it's a terrible app as well, but all devices are currently working fine from the Wemo app. My main motivation with Alexa/Echo was home automation control, but it's not reliable. Waking up to a noise, and saying \"Alexa; lights on\" should, you know, turn on the lights. But Alexa hesitates for a substantial period of time, then might (or might not) turn on a totally random selection of Wemo devices. Not ready for Prime time, pun intended. Alexa and my Echo devices are mostly just music streaming speakers now, and the only devices with a decent speaker for that purpose are the tall original Echos. Besides, with Amazon devices, unlike Google Home, you can't get the same stream coordinated on multiple devices concurrently. The Echo Show speakers are very directional (and the device is also hard of hearing.) If I could undo the whole mess, I would today.","author":"Mike St James","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":1,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-07-29T00:00:00.000Z"}

{"review":"--Update for calling causes app to crash constantly. After installing it looks like it will open and work properly, but when it gets to the step where it requires you to pick your name from a list, it crashes. I can't skip the voice set up, but attempting to complete it crashes the app every time. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a half dozen times to fix it - not only is it wasting my time, it's making my $500 in Alexa devices significantly less useful. Completely flipping worthless update - don't risk it til the bugs are repaired.--  Update: the bugs are repaired. Voice calling works seamlessly between my phone and all of my Alexa devices. I only wish the app had better control settings for IOT devices.","author":"Melanie F.","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":1,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"}

{"review":"Not sure why so many bad reviews. Seems a lot of reviews are on the device itself and not the app. 2 totally different things. Once paired you really don't need the app. App works great and always has same with the echo itself. Never had 1 issue. It understands me 99.9% of the time the other .1% is because either the tv is too loud but not the device itself. Someone was talking carp about searching music. Just say a name of a song or artist and it will be played. I think most reviews are due to user error and not the device. Sure the app could use a little work but for the most part it works flawlessly. Easy to find skills and set alarms, add more devices and link my smart home devices. I don't know why people say it's hard to connect to WiFi because it is the easiest device I've ever hooked up to my wifi. Its never lost connection either. Only when the power has gone out but as soon as it's back on so is alexa. I have over 70 devices paired with the app and alexa has not once messed up when giving a command to lock a door or turn on a light. I would definitely recommend it over Google home any day.","author":"trucker V","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":5,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z"}

I have a Google Home Mini only for questions, since Amazon Echo is so far ahead of Google Home for home automation capabilities, but I've figured out Alexa can now answer just about everything Google can.

Great at understanding. I've had the echo since it was pre order.  So good I ordered 2 dots they have never got better at anything....what a waste of money. I've just pre orderd a new echo. Second gen.....UPDATE it got delivered to someone else, no delivery card....what a going on...they had to send another, one. Its here, it's as good as the Original although it's not working at the moment. None of the skills or music. On the whole house and we have 4 in total.....

Hope it stays this way.  ////  Update:  Wow!  So now we're purging conservative radio stations from the Amazon/Alexa feed, huh?  I tried to ask Alexa to play my favorite radio station, and I got back \"105.9 FM WMAL on iHeart Radio isn't available right now.\"  Just to make sure it wasn't a temporary glitch, I waited and asked again, and got the same, only restated: \"105.9 FM WMAL on iHeart Radio is currently not available.\"  Which is funny (NOT), 'cause I can go straight to iHeart Radio on my Android tablet, and it immediately plays, just fine.  Amazon, you had better stop boycotting/purging stations just 'cause you don't like their content!  Not happy at all with Amazon over this.  Fix now!  Immediately!  Or you will be reported to the FCC!  ////  Second Update:  Finally, Landscape Mode has been restored!!  Thank you, Amazon, for providing this update for all of us tablet owners, and for the disabled who rely on Landscape Mode for their special devices.  As I said before, this has always been a 5 Star application.  Brilliantly thought out.  Superbly executed.  Great UI.  Now that it supports tablets, it is perfect.  Thanks again, Amazon!  BVI User.  ////  First Update: After calling and emailing Amazon, Landscape Mode has still not been restored for their handicapped/disabled users.  Numerous reviews have been posted by other handicapped/disabled people asking why, and no response from Amazon.  Poor customer response and service.  So, down to One Star you go.  What a shame, for an otherwise responsible and squared-away company.  Pay attention to your handicapped/disabled users!  ////  This would have been a 5 Star review...  Until yesterday.  Minus One Star for taking away Landscape Mode.  Hey, some of out here have large screen tablets and are not gonna twist them around just to see your app's screen.  Those of us with Visual Impairments need the widescreen display.  Please make the orientation an option, Landscape or Portrait.  Minus One Star for removing the identifying colors and symbols for our music apps.  Again, those of us with Visual Impairments used to be able to find our iHeartRadio app by looking for the \"red square.\"  The TuneIn Radio app was easily located by looking for the \"aqua square.\"  Granted, I'm sure that the black \u0026 white menus look very modern and sophisticated, but they're not friendly for the Visually Impaired.  Please add an option to put the color back.  Otherwise, great app!  I can control my Tap from either my tablet or new iPhone seamlessly.  Just please be considerate of us Visually Impaired people.

{"review":"If I could give this app a negative review I would. I'm not a huge fan of my dot to begin with but the app just destroys any positive feelings I might have had.   One of the biggest things I use the app for is text to speech on my Kindle books. Not only can I not arrange how I want the icons to look or hide services I don't use, but I can't   search through my books for the title I want or sort them. It is also virtually impossible to just say \"Alexa read XXXXX\" because she has no idea what I'm talking about.  My roommate foumd the same thing when she tried to get the app to read to her. You have to dig through all the books to find the one you want and then hit play.   Also, Alexa is extremely  spotty with pronunciation (i.e., a character whose name is Manny sometimes gets called Man, sometimes pronounced Many and sometimes pronounced Manny; a character named Colin is sometimes prounced like Cawlin and sometimes like Colon).  All that being said, the biggest thing I hate about the app is that it randomly stops, as if a sleep timer went off and it stops reading. If I wake her up by saying \"Alexa\", she reads a few more words and then stops or she will randomly start reading again (i.e., a 3 am the book will come back on for a sentence or two and then will stop again). This would continue the whole book if I let it. Amazon says it's most likely the internet connection but I can tell you it absolutely is not.   I realize Alexa was a pioneer in AI in her early days, but one would think Amazon would have improved her since then. Not so much.","author":"Marlise Anderson","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":1,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-11-19T00:00:00.000Z"}

You can have the recipes sent to your phone so don't need to search for pen or paper.

This is b.s..  also they took away the ability to remove items from your smart home and replaced it with a disable option.

You have turned a useful smart home interface into a garbage collecting bin which you will probably use to try to shovel more you wanted items down our throats.

It's not the same volume control as where you would find in the normal 'reminders and alarms' section so the volume of the music pulled from my prime music or even on Pandora just wakes me up at a very loud volume. Would be nice to be able to control how loud the content plays in the alarm, not just one set volume where I wake up with a heart attack. It also doesn't turn on from the last volume setting, the volume could be set to 3 but the music alarm turns on to volume 7.

One should be able. To browse for music from the recently played tracks and then play them at any time. Also, as of now Alexa does not support chat or voice msg or calling feature to any other Alexa user, which should be there.

{"review":"Lately, all of my Echo devices are constantly telling me that there was a problem executing the command or that the device lost its connection. All my other devices are connected with no issues and this happens while my FireTV is steadily streaming (and yes, I have more than enough bandwidth for multiple streams, etc). This is most frustrating. The music groups are useless because if you have your device connected to a Bluetooth speaker, it severs the connection and plays the music thru the device (which sounds horrible on a Dot). Furthermore, the Tap can't be added to a music group. Calling one of your other devices is interesting, but it would be more useful as an intercom without having to \"answer\" with a command. (I want to give my 3-year-old instructions in another room, but he can't answer the call) Calling another device also severs any Bluetooth connections.

Setting up a simple Alexa echo has taken days with no progress because of how much the app freezes. Unfortunately mandatory.

It's nothing more than a tablet without a screen but i love it. It's like a tablet for your mind if you learn it, use it enough, and train it and it can really fit seamlessly into your life. Being able to walk into my house and play a song i wish i had heard on the radio just by saying hey Alexa play \"whatever\" or being able to ask her to continue my sports talk show when i walk in is such a simple feature but so cool. It's nice to not have to find a new device when i walk in to reconnect everything i was listening to. The Echo Dot solves all those problems and there price is great. Highly recommended for anyone especially people who dont think they can use  something new like this.

The Canadian app doesn't allow you to set up different household users, even though the instructions to set this up is in the Help area. The option simply isn't in the app. When my wife set up her phone on the echo it deleted all of my functions and skills.  Also some skills are not available on the Canadian app, like the skill for my security system that is available in the US. Maybe accessing the skill through a proxy might work?","author":"Bob Staff","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":4,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"}

{"review":"I love my new Echo! It is really cool! On tablets the calling and texting feature doesn't work but here's a way to fix it. 1. Search on the play store for an app that gives you a free phone number. 2. Type Amazon account into your web browser, and click the 1st or 2nd result and sign in and add the phone number you just got; follow the instructions. 3. Borrow a friend's compatible phone and sign in with your amazon account, then click the middle button on the bottom, follow the instructions. DO NOT ALLOW CONTACTS. IF YOU DO ALL YOUR FRIEND'S CONTACTS WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR ECHO, AND MESS THE WHOLE THING UP. If you've followed these steps, try calling on your Echo. Your Echo will call just phone numbers, not contacts. 4. Delete the Alexa app from your friend's phone. Now you will be able to call! This is the only way to do it without buying a phone. This app is a pain.","author":"","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":4,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2017-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"}

The app updates itself and is now completely functionless. Customer support suggested that the only way I can attempt to fix it is by resetting my phone to factory settings, then reinstalling the Alexa app. Seriously? I have to delete all contacts, photos, everything from my phone and then start over. Not a chance. Hundreds of other reviews have stated similar problems, and we have a lot of techies in this house.

Also Google Assistant is far far more natural in understanding what you are saying, Alexa requires very precise commands and doesn't always get them right, and I hate the excuse people are saying that \"you have to make your own 'skills'\", no I really shouldn't need too! This should have machine learning and just understand me however I say it! Google does that perfectly by comparison...

{"review":"Fire everyone involved with working on this app! It has not worked for me for over 6 months. I have tried everything. I have downloaded older versions and I have tried the most up-to-date versions. All end up doing the same thing in the long run, which is work for one day then the next day all I get is a white screen with the home button and music button on the bottom but I cannot do anything with it. It's strange that it works for one day after he eats update. But that tells me it more than likely has nothing to do with my phone which is the latest Samsung Galaxy 8. There is also nothing wrong with my network I have reset everything I have problems with nothing but this app. I'm going to try the Google mini. If that works will I will not be turning back to this product ever again. I have an echo dot which by itself is a fine piece of equipment, it's the app that needs to be thrown out.

{"review":"I give 5 stars because I love my Alexa devices, but feel the \"Routines\" feature has a lot of room for growth.  So far, I've been happy with what it can do and have had a little fun playing with it.  I like walking into my office in the morning and saying \"Alexa, time to get to work\" and having all my lights turn on, followed by news and sports updates.  \n\nAdmittedly, my gripe comes from the app's lack of imagination. I envision being able to change the color/dimming of the lighting, and having the option to trigger a particular song/artist/genre of music to begin playing.  My sick, twisted mind hypothesized a scenario where I say \"Alexa, it's business time\" and the lights dim, change color, and Flight of the Concords starts playing.  Just seems like it could be a lot of fun!","author":"rdrnr7551","review_source":"iTunes","rating":5,"title":"Love it, but it has room to grow.","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-01-20T01:02:28.000Z"}

{"review":"The app overall contains alot of very useful items. Music, shopping list, etc. \nThere are a few things that standout as needing immediate correction:\nThe volume control on the app is the absolute worst I (and hundreds of others) have ever seen. It's glitchy and the user can't even see the volume control under their finger because of the poor design. This causes the volume to go to zero at times as well as jumping up way past where the user wants it to be.\nIt's time Amazon enable the volume buttons on the phones to work the music volume. (Harmony has done a wonderful job with that on their remote control hub app). \nAdditionally, the app must stop refreshing when behind the scenes. It must stay in the state the user placed it before going on to do other things.\nNow Alexa herself... She NEEDS a better search engine, ability, and A.I.   I think perhaps Bing is the current search from what I understand. But that's not the whole issue. Alexia seems to be able to find and understand little of the real world and information users ask. \nI expect at least an 8 out if 10 from Amazon. At this time, Alexa and this app are a solid 6 at best. We expect better.","author":"Mike ip6s+","review_source":"iTunes","rating":3,"title":"Not bad but needs help","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-01-24T11:11:52.000Z"}

Basically the app is useless unless you get echo or whatever... at that point the device just leaches function from your phone... maybe I'm wrong but looking at the horrid ratings on this app tells me Amazon is taking a wrong turn here, too bad, I actually liked their services.","author":"William Kimball","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":2,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-01-27T00:00:00.000Z"}

{"review":"I give this app 2 stars for the vital functionality it provides to administer your Echo devices. But, it‚Äôs really a horrendously clunky app. The usability was always bad but it has gotten worse with successive updates. Not only are the aesthetics still bad, but the performance/speed is atrocious. Half of my usage is spent wondering if the pulsating 3 dots are a wait indicator or if the transaction stalled. \n\nIn sloppy updates, recent versions have made the volume control bar harder to use than before. I have to play a song to change the volume in my kids room which means if it‚Äôs up high they get blasted at night when I‚Äôm starting sleep music remotely. The volume slider is crazy hard to touch and the volume number is under my finger. \n\nSeriously, I can‚Äôt list all the bad usability in this thing but if the performance was more reliable and snappier, I could live with bad design. \n\nIn missing features, why can‚Äôt I set the music volume low and comfortable as a background setting, and get Alexa‚Äôs voice volume high so she‚Äôs not whispering to me when I ask the song name.","author":"GreenJump","review_source":"iTunes","rating":2,"title":"Disappointed!","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-01-31T13:01:36.000Z"}

{"review":"Alexa is more of a novelty, not much there for practical use. It would be nice if Amazon programmed Alexa to perform more routines when you say a specific command. For instance, it would play a specific type of music station (ie relaxing music or sounds) when I give a specific command (Alexa, time to get ready for bed).  Another nice feature would be to link reminders to Alexa in routines, such as when I say ‚ÄúAlexa, Good Morning‚Äù on a Monday, she would tell me the reminders I have programmed for Mondays. Linking a smart phone ‚Äúreminder‚Äù app to Alexa, to play when a routine is created, would be fabulous!  Right now, aside from asking her to play music (most of what I listen to isn‚Äôt available on Amazon Music) and use her for my morning routine to get weather, traffic, and daily briefing, I don‚Äôt use it much.  It seems to be in an infancy stage even after a couple of years.  It could be great.

It does what it should, but is slow, disorganized \u0026 unbelievably annoying. Why is there no option to set smart home, skills, shopping list or anything else for that matter as the opening screen? Why is it that in order to add a smart bulb or switch as I add to my system that I need to discover ALL devices \u0026 then have to delete many Roku channels or Hue presets that I never use?  Why is it not possible to set the device list to alphabetical and for it to remain that way? Why are there no widgets for, example, shopping or to-do lists. And finally, my laptop boots up faster than this app takes to open. Bottom line is I would think some Amazon braniac would be able to improve this.

{"review":"Feb 2018 review. My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! \n\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \n\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \"now playing \" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \"snappy\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus.

Alexa can be loud and my sister has a roommate so sometimes especially at night my sister wants to be able to control the smart devices from the Alexa/Amazon.com website via a specialized computer in order to not disturb her roommate.

{"review":"Feb 2018 review. My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! It took some figuring out but now, instead of turning on Alexa music, then my blue tooth shower radio and instantly hearing music, I have to go into settings, blue tooth, and manually connect my external speaker each time. Add to that the fact that ‚Äúrecent‚Äù music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \n\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \n\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \"now playing \" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \"snappy\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus. I would love to revert to the older version.","author":"kenr96","review_source":"iTunes","rating":2,"title":"warning for update Feb 2018","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-02-09T12:18:42.000Z"}

{"review":"Continued problems with external Bluetooth speaker for Dot. What the hell are these developers doing? They are literally forcing people to google and Apple. In the good ole days before this app became too bloated for its on good, i could turn on my external Bluetooth speaker, ask my Alexa Dot to play music and it would automatically play through my external speaker. Those days are gone people!! LISTEN TO ME!!!! THEY ARE GONE!! NO MORE!!! Now I have to pair the dot and speaker each time I want to use the external speaker. It‚Äôs a multi-step time consuming process. These developers must be getting minimum wage as there is absolutely no incentive to get an app out there that works. They fix one thing and break another. I‚Äôm on the verge of going with Apple new home device, or even google for that matter. \n\nFeb 2018 review. My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! It took some figuring out but now, instead of turning on Alexa music, then my blue tooth shower radio and instantly hearing music, I have to go into settings, blue tooth, and manually connect my external speaker each time. Add to that the fact that ‚Äúrecent‚Äù music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \n\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \n\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \"now playing \" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \"snappy\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus. I would love to revert to the older version.","author":"kenr96","review_source":"iTunes","rating":1,"title":"warning for update Feb 2018","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-02-11T16:15:18.000Z"}

Still not great as the interface is poorly designed and somewhat buggy, but I changed my rating from a 2 to 3 for average.\n\nWhy is it that that companies feel that they must constantly update apps that are perfectly functional in the first place. In this case, Amazon felt that they needed to completely overhaul the UI for an app that was already good (not great) and made it MUCH worse. One thing that is particularly bothersome to me is that the volume slider which use to be fine, is now very difficult to use. As soon as you touch it the volume jumps down two levels, and then is very difficult to adjust. The button is so small you can't see it or the volume level while adjusting.

{"review":"So there was an update to the Alexa app Feb 14, 2018. As usual, nothing specific listed in the update description other than the usual rubber stamped ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù crap. But many problems still persist. Automatic Bluetooth connection to external speakers (Dot) is still a thing of the past. Now requires multi-step paring each time. The app is total garbage!\n\nContinued problems with external Bluetooth speaker for Dot. What the hell are these developers doing? They are literally forcing people to google and Apple. In the good ole days before this app became too bloated for its on good, i could turn on my external Bluetooth speaker, ask my Alexa Dot to play music and it would automatically play through my external speaker. Those days are gone people!! LISTEN TO ME!!!! THEY ARE GONE!! NO MORE!!! Now I have to pair the dot and speaker each time I want to use the external speaker. It‚Äôs a multi-step time consuming process. These developers must be getting minimum wage as there is absolutely no incentive to get an app out there that works. They fix one thing and break another. I‚Äôm on the verge of going with Apple new home device, or even google for that matter. \n\nFeb 2018 review. My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! It took some figuring out but now, instead of turning on Alexa music, then my blue tooth shower radio and instantly hearing music, I have to go into settings, blue tooth, and manually connect my external speaker each time. Add to that the fact that ‚Äúrecent‚Äù music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \n\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \n\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \"now playing \" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \"snappy\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus. I would love to revert to the older version.","author":"kenr96","review_source":"iTunes","rating":1,"title":"warning for update Feb 2018","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-02-15T12:10:57.000Z"}

I can't be the only one irritated by this.","author":"Miranda Tucker","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":1,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-02-24T00:00:00.000Z"}

{"review":"Unable to delete devices from the app so I have about 5 duplicate hue bulbs in this thing. Voice commands are stupid at best.  I have bedroom fan light as a group and only that. If I'm waking up in the morning and say bedroom fan lights the system is too stupid to know that there is no device called lightS and to just go with light. This is the difference between AI and simply a trigger word which is what Amazon uses. There's no intelligence behind the system.","author":"Kellic AnonymousTiger","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":2,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-02-25T00:00:00.000Z"}

I looked back at that when I was not home near Alexa, now I can't do that. Went to show a friend and it says it is not supported, ask Alexa, hard to do when you are not near it.   Newest issue, when I go to music, TuneIn in the app, it shows I'm in a different city and state and Alexa can't find a station I have listened to since I got the Dot.","author":"George Geller","review_source":"GooglePlayStore","rating":2,"title":"","product_name":"Amazon Alexa","reviewed_date":"2018-02-26T00:00:00.000Z"}
